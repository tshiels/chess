This program plays a Human vs. Computer game of Chess. The progam implements the Minimax algorithm that searches through 3 levels of the game tree. 
The evaluation function to score the board ranks the relative importance of each piece on the board,
with white and black pieces having equal and opposite point values, and adds the two scores together.
